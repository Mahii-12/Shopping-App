# Technology Stack:

## Java, Maven, Spring Boot, Hibernate: 
* I chose Java as the programming language due to its robustness and widespread usage. Spring Boot simplifies the setup of Spring-based applications, while Hibernate facilitates object-relational mapping (ORM) for  streamlining database interactions and Spring Security with JWT authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## MySQL Database:
* Utilized MySQL database to store user, account, and transaction data. MySQL offers robust relational database management capabilities, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Scalability and SOLID Principles:

* SOLID Principles:
> Adhered to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to design a modular, maintainable, and extensible system. Ensured scalability and future enhancements by following best practices in system design and architecture.


## CRUD Operations:
* Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing users, their orders and users transactions effectively. Ensured seamless handling of user and order for products data manipulation for enhanced user experience.


## Testing and Validation:
* Utilized Postman for comprehensive testing and validation of REST endpoints. Conducted functional testing to ensure correct behavior and adherence to specified requirements, enhancing system reliability.

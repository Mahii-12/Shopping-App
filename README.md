# Technology Stack:

## Java, Maven, Spring Boot, Hibernate: 
* I chose Java as the programming language due to its robustness and widespread usage. Spring Boot simplifies the setup of Spring-based applications, while Hibernate facilitates object-relational mapping (ORM) for  streamlining database interactions and Spring Security with JWT authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Entities:
 * Users:
   > Represents the users of your application.
* Products:
   > Represents the products available for purchase.
 * Orders:
   > Represents the orders placed by users, containing details such as the products ordered, quantity, total amount, and any applied discounts.

## MySQL Database:
* Used MySQL as the database to store user information, product details, and order information.
* The database schema includes tables for users, products, and orders, with appropriate relationships established between them.

## Scalability and SOLID Principles:

* SOLID Principles:
> Adhered to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to design a modular, maintainable, and extensible system. Ensured scalability and future enhancements by following best practices in system design and architecture.


## CRUD Operations:
* Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing users, their orders and users transactions effectively. Ensured seamless handling of user and order for products data manipulation for enhanced user experience.


## Testing and Validation:
* Utilized Postman for comprehensive testing and validation of REST endpoints. Conducted functional testing to ensure correct behavior and adherence to specified requirements, enhancing system reliability.
